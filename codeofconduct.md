#  The Quick Version

Our workshop is dedicated to providing a harassment-free workshop experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of workshop participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate for any workshop venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter, Facebook, and other online media. Workshop participants violating these rules may be asked to leave the workshop.



# The Less Quick Version
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, we may take any action we deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the workshop.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the workshop staff immediately.

The workshop staff will be happy to help participants to assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the workshop. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at our workshop and workshop venues and workshop-related social events.

If you have any questions or suggestions about our Code of Conduct, do not hesitate to contact us.
